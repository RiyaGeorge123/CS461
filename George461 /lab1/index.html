  <h4>Learning Web Design</h4>
  <p style="color: red;">
  Web design” is a pretty open-ended term. Often people who are new to web design feel overwhelmed <br>
  at everything there is to learn.That’s understandable, but just remember that it’s like any other <br>
  discipline; with proper dedication and focus you’ll progress quickly.Here’s my favorite advice to <br>
  new web designers on learning web design:<br></p><br>


  <h4>Learning how the web works</h4> 
  <p>I’m always amazed at how many web designers focus on learning “just what they need to know” and <br>
  ignore how the web actually works. Without understanding how web servers, protocols, browsers, and <br>
  other related web technology works, you’ll never really understand the context behind why you do the things you do,<br>
  the things you do, and what makes one practice better than another.<br>
  </p><br>


  <h4 style="color: royalblue;">Determine an area of focus, and start there.</h4>
  <p>There are a lot of areas of web design that you could specialize in, so I’d recommend learning as much <br>
  about them as you can, to determine which areas interest you. Then, spend as much time learning about <br>
  your specific area of focus as possible. Once you achieve a level of proficiency, begin to branch out into <br>
  other areas as well.<br>
  </p><br>

  <h4>Never stop learning</h4>
  <p>The web is constantly evolving. Even if you become the absolute best there is in a specific field, chances <br>
  are new techniques and approaches will come along within the year that will make your current skill set <br>
  less desirable. Understand that being a good web designer means embracing the changing nature of the web.<br>
  </p><br>


  <h4> Break things! </h4>
  <p>There is no better teacher than experience. Build and experiment constantly. Ask yourself, <br>
    <b><i>“what would happen if I?...”</b></i> or <b><i>“wonder if I could build?...”</b></i> and then go out <br>
    and build it. If you’re like me, you’ll fail a good bit of the time, but the process of trying things and <br>
    breaking them will make you that much better. Always challenge yourself.<br><br>
</p><br>

    <h2> Web Design Resources</h2>
    <h3> HTML related titles</h3>
    <h4> Web Design related titles</h4>
    <h5> HTML specifications </h5>

<p>Although their format can be a bit hard to read initially, once you’re familiar with them there is no better <br>
  resource for learning HTML and staying current with it than reading the actual W3C specifications. <br>
